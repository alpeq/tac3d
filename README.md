# Tactile 3D Exploration and Perception Project

1. `objects` contains the CAD design
2. `arduino_readout` contains the Arduino readout scheme for event-based tactile sensors
3. `franka_panda` is a program to pull Franka Panda robot descriptions and build the URDF file (not finished yet)
4. `python` contains the scripts for tactile perception (temporary)
5. `tactile_sensor` contains the KiCAD project of the sensor design

## To-do List
1. `ROS2` integration for realtime robot control and perception
